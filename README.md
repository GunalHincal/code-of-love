# ❤️ Code of Love

**Live Demo:** [https://code-of-love-gamma.vercel.app/](https://code-of-love-gamma.vercel.app/)

A heart drawn with code, animated with emotion.

## 🌟 About the Project

This is an interactive heart animation built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When the user clicks the **“Press Me”** button:

1. Background music starts playing  
2. A heart is drawn step-by-step in real time  
3. Firework-style confetti bursts randomly across the screen  
4. Colorful mini hearts fill the screen  
5. The user can erase the screen using a magic sponge  
6. As they erase, a glowing heart with the message **“I LOVE YOU”** is revealed

The animation is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## 💡 Inspiration

This project is a reminder that code can be romantic too.  
Sometimes, the most meaningful messages are written not in letters — but in functions, loops, and pixels.

A simple but magical interaction to surprise someone you care about.
